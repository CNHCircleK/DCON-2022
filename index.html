    <div id="chair-message">
      Are you ready to take a trip of a lifetime? Get ready and jump in a car with some awesome friends so we can all take a ROADTRIP to District Convention 2018 at the LAX Marriott! The journey sure doesn’t end once you get to Los Angeles though! From <strong>March 23rd-25th</strong>, Circle K’ers from all over the California-Nevada-Hawaii District have the opportunity to caravan together and celebrate a year’s worth of accomplishments. When you get there, slow down and embrace each new place you’ll visit during your travels at DCON. The District Convention Committee has worked extremely hard to make sure each and every turn opens your eyes to a beautiful place where you can share your love for Circle K’s three tenets: Service, Leadership, and Fellowship. The map for District Convention includes pit stops to:
      <ul>
        <li>Elect new leadership to guide us through the upcoming year</li>
        <li>Attend workshops that will keep our minds well-oiled</li>
        <li>Participate in an on-site service project for a productive break</li>
        <li>Honor our graduating members, sending them off to their next adventure</li>
        <li>Speed through different careers and experiences at the Professional Exposition</li>
        <li>Bond with members across CNH, singing roadtrip tunes</li>
        <li>AND SO MUCH MORE!</li>
      </ul>
      Fill up a full tank of gas because this is going to be a trip that will take you along the sea, over hills, and around mountains. This weekend is going to be an epic journey—one definitely for the books. We can’t wait to take this ROADTRIP with you!

          <p>What's up CNH! To make sure that District Convention is super awesome this year, we’ll need SAAs to make sure everything and everyone acts according to plan! Clubs are required to provide SAA volunteers if they bring 4 or more members to District Convention.
             If a club brings 4 members or fewer, then that club is required to provide 1 SAA volunteer. For any club that brings an additional 4 members to District Convention, then that club must provide 1 additional SAA.<br/>
             <strong>Example: 20 members = 5 SAA volunteers.</strong><br/><br/>

             <strong>Why should you be a SAA?</strong><br/>
             SAA stands for Sergeant-At-Arms. An SAA is a volunteer during District Convention that makes sure that attendees are safe, aware, and reminded of Convention Rules, Code of Conduct and Dress Codes, and are enjoying District Convention.
             SAAs will be assign a shift that they must carry out. After their shift is completed, they will receive a gift from the SAA Chair as a thank you!<br/><br/>
